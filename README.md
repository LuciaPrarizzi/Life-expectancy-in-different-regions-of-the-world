Life-expectancy-in-different-regions-of-the-world
🩺​🧪🪙The objective of this project is to evaluate how different demographic, economic and health variables correlate with life expectancy at birth and adult mortality.

🎯 Project Objectives The main objectives of this study are:

-Explore and Visualize: Identify trends and geographical disparities in life expectancy worldwide.

-Country Clustering: Apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment countries into groups with similar health and socioeconomic profiles.

-Identify Key Factors: Determine which variables (such as Health Expenditure, Education, or Infant Mortality) are most strongly correlated with life expectancy within and between groups.

-Generate Policy Implications: Offer differentiated public policy recommendations, with a special emphasis on the Silver Economy.

🛠️ Technologies and Requirements This project was developed using the following technology stack:

-Language: Python 3.13.5

-Analysis Libraries:

Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and processing.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning (clustering, modeling, evaluation, and feature selection).

-Statistics: Implementation of non-parametric tests such as Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U to validate differences between clusters.
